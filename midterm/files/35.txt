สิงค์โปร์ได้วัคซีนต้านไวรัส covid แล้ว
The first shipment of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines arrived in Singapore this evening at about 8 pm. Its arrival marks a significant milestone in Singapore’s fight against COVID-19. This is the culmination of months of discussions with pharmaceutical companies and the hard work of many public officers working behind the scenes to secure early access to safe and effective vaccines for our population. The vaccines will undergo a thorough inspection to ensure that they are received in good condition, and that the cold chain was maintained during transportation from the manufacturing plant to Singapore. Thereafter the vaccines will be placed in a storage facility with capabilities to handle ultra-cold storage at about -80°C, until we begin vaccination. At that point, the vaccines will be thawed and transported to the vaccination site, where it can be kept in refrigerators at 2°C to 8°C for up to five days. Only vaccines that meet strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness will be used for our population. We have procured enough vaccines for all Singaporeans and long-term residents in Singapore to get vaccinated by end 2021, if there are no unforeseen disruptions to vaccine shipments. We will progressively vaccinate our population, starting with healthcare workers and COVID-19 frontline workers, who are at higher risk of exposure to COVID-19 and hence most in need of COVID-19 vaccination. While COVID-19 vaccination will be voluntary, we strongly encourage everyone to get vaccinated when the vaccine is offered to you. A COVID-19 vaccine will expedite our recovery from the pandemic, but it is not a silver bullet that will immediately end the pandemic. It will be some time before the world returns to pre-COVID normalcy. In the meantime, let us keep up our fight and keep one another safe. https://www.facebook.com/154909330630/posts/10158743923610631/ -- ส่วนเราช่วงนี้คงต้องประคองตัวไปก่อน
